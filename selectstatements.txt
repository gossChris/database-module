1. Write out a generic SELECT statement.

SELECT movie
FROM theatertable
WHERE movie='Endgame";

2. Create a fun way to remember the order of operations in a SELECT statement, such as a mnemonic.

SCFTAAC
(SELECT COLUMS FROM TABLE AND ADD CONDTIONS)

3. Given this dogs table, write queries to select the following pieces of data:

SELECT id
FROM dogs
WHERE age < 1;


Display the name and age of all dogs that are female and over 35lbs.

SELECT name, age
FROM dogs
WHERE gender = 'F' AND weight > 35;

WHERE breed NOT LIKE '%shepherd';


Display the id, age, weight, and breed of all dogs that are either over 60lbs or Great Danes.

SELECT id, age, weight, breed

4. Given this cats table, what records are returned from these queries?
SELECT name, adoption_date FROM cats;
SELECT name, age FROM cats;

Two results, one being the name and and adoptions date of  all cats, and the other being the name and age of all cats.

Display the name and sex of all cats who are 7 years old.

SELECT name, gender
FROM cats
Where age = 7;


Find all of the names of the cats, so you don’t choose duplicate names for new cats.

SELECT name
FROM cats;


5. List each comparison operator and explain when you would use it. Include a real world example for each.

> to find a value greater than the listed value ( WHERE age > 5) 
< to find a value less than the listed value  (WHERE age < 5)
= to find a value that is equal to the listed value (WHERE age = 5)
<= to find a value that is less than or equal to the listed value (WHERE age <= 5)
>= to find a value that is greater than or equal to the listed value (WHERE age >= 5)
!= to find a value that is NOT equal to the listed value (WHERE age != 5)
<> to find a value that is less than or greater than the listed value (WHERE age <> 5)
